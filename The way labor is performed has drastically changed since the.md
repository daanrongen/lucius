# Introduction

The way labor is performed has drastically changed since the application of the theories of scientific management, introduced in 20th century Taylorism. By minimalizing labor intensity, efficiency can be optimized, resulting in more lucrative business management in factories. With the arrival of the digital- and information age, more and more workers find their jobs in communication and technological sectors. It could be argued that modern offices are "intellectual factories", where the same Taylorist ideas could be applied. Every office worker would receive a desk, computer and chair. The reduction of labor intensity in this case can easily be seen in a heavy reduction of physical activity to improve intellectual processes. Science has proven that lack of physical activity results in alarming health disorders such as cardiovascular diseases. The deeper problem lies in the sitting culture currently established in modern office environments. These environments are designed for office employees to perform their work while seated. Therefore, to a behavioural intervention is required.

How can we learn office workers to work more dynamically, using an IoT-application where physical activity is stimulated and ergonomic information is gathered to raise awareness about the sitting culture? How can we help office workers stand up against seating culture?
