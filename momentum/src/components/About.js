          With the introduction of the Modern Effiency Desk in the early 1920â€™s,
          a new era of how we work has begun. The office environment has been
          designed with the goal of performing labor with minimal exertion on
          arbitrary tasks and optimal focus on desk tasks.

        <p>
          Due to this transition, we have been facing characteristics of a
          sedentary lifestyle. We sit in our car when we drive to work, where we
          sit to perform our job, to get home to sit on the couch before we go
          to bed. This decrease in physical activity results in serious health
          issues.

          Trusting experts, the solution lies in adopting a different way of
          performing our daily jobs. A habit, or behaviour, in which we learn to
          switch frequently and rhythmically between sitting, standing and
          moving.

          This product aims to improve your physical activity without reducing
          your work productivity. The Buoy makes you move more while seated and
          shows you insights on your sitting behaviour based on three pillars:
          the amount of time spent seated, the amount of in-chair movement and
          how well your sitting posture is.
